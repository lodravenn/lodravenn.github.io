- "Reused content" : content that doesn’t provide significant original commentary, or educational value

- If your channel's content is mainly based on third party content, such as compilations, music promotion, gameplays or react videos that don't include significant original content or value, especially if the videos go on for extended periods of time, there is a chance that it can be considered as reuse of content by YouTube, even if you have permission

- You can upload the original version of your live, but why not change it a little to fit the more demanding and less loyal audiences on YouTube who weren’t able to watch the live in real-time?

- Just cut off some pauses in talks or less informative parts of the video. This way, you will bring the same value in shorter timing.

- The spirit of this policy is to make sure we’re monetizing original content that adds value to viewers. If you put a funny or thoughtful spin on content you didn’t originally create, you’ve transformed the content in some way. In other words, we allow reused content if viewers can tell that there’s a meaningful difference between the original video and your video.
