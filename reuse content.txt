If you cannot add narration because there is already talking then you could add an intro and outro where you add your own content/value. Also add credit to copyright owner and note "used with permission".

The intro can be summary of content and origin.

You could also replace some the narration and content with your own.

"Reused content. This is content that doesn’t provide significant original commentary, or educational value. It may also mean that we’ve identified that large portions of your channel either completely match other content, or are noticeably similar. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Third-party videos stitched together with minimal to no changes

- Third-party content compiled without a narrative

- Content uploaded many times by multiple users

- Content uploaded somewhere else first

If your channel's content is mainly based on third party content, such as compilations, music promotion, or similar, or you create gameplays or react videos that don't include significant original content or value, especially if the videos go on for extended periods of time, there is a chance that it can be considered as reuse of content by YouTube, even if you have permission

You should also keep in mind that when you are using third party content in your videos, obtaining written permission or license from the rights holder prior of using the content and making sure that your production can be considered as fair use.

Even after seeking the required permission to reuse the content on you channel, you still need to make sure that you creatively add some value to it

You can also record an additional one-minute video with a short intro to paste in the beginning. Maybe you have your own branded one already, don’t forget to include it.

Certainly, you can upload the original version of your live, but why not change it a little to fit the more demanding and less loyal audiences on YouTube who weren’t able to watch the live in real-time?

Just cut off some pauses in talks or less informative parts of the video. This way, you will bring the same value in shorter timing.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can further argue that my work is original, transformative in nature, and covered by Fair Use

Some of the most common reasons for not being accepted are regarding the AdSense Program policies, specifically related to reused or repetitious content -- content that is "very similar or exactly the same across videos and channels".

"no promotion(not the entile channel for)"
"no added value (educational or commentary)"

- What is allowed to monetize
The spirit of this policy is to make sure we’re monetizing original content that adds value to viewers. If you put a funny or thoughtful spin on content you didn’t originally create, you’ve transformed the content in some way. In other words, we allow reused content if viewers can tell that there’s a meaningful difference between the original video and your video.

- What is not allowed to monetize
Clips of moments from your favorite show edited together with little or no narrative
Content uploaded many times by other creators
Promotion of other people’s content (even if you have permission)
