				<h1 id="header">About</h1>	
			
				<p>LoDravenn is a highlights channel in collaboration with Tyler1. The best momments in Tyler1's live stream are edited together with high-quality, transformative editing into unique highlights video. Over 15 hours of work goes into each video with 10+ hours spent on editing alone ensuring we create something original that you can’t find anywhere else.</p>

			
				<h2>How we edit </h2>	
				
				<p>Editing is creative work and requires a lot of inspiration to get right. We spend a lot of time brainstorming how best to present certain footage of the livestream a.k.a VOD(Video-On-Demand). We only want to use footage that we can add creative value to and present in a unique way because we don’t want to be a reupload content channel, we want to make original content in collaboration with Tyler1.</p>
				
				<p>All our videos start with reviewing the VOD. There is alot of good footage in the VOD and the best ones are hand picked. We always wait 24 hours after the VOD is publised before uploading 
				so that we can stick to our policy of only using footage the original creator doesn't use on his YT channel and footage we have original ideas for how to edit.</p>

				</div>
				
				<p>Once we have the footage picked out we import them into Adobe Premiere and start the editing process.</p>
				
				<h2>1. Recording Twitch Chat</h2>
				

				<p>Chat is an essential part of the Twitch experience as it allows viewers and streamers interact with each other. Seeing those interaction is part of what makes livestream so great. Because Twitch chat is integrated in the website, so in order to add Twitch chat in our video, we'll have to go through the whole livestream, record it separately and then add it later in the editing. The recording process could take hours depend on the footage we intended to use.</p>
					
				<div class="img-div">
					<video autoplay loop muted src="src/1.mp4"></video>
				</div>

				<h2>2. Cuts and Effects</h2>
				
				<p>After we have added the chat, we start cutting the video. We usually use alot of jump cut to make the flow of video more natural, conversational tone. The original footage can include a lot of “ums”, pauses, and other mistakes. Jump cuts are the perfect solution to clean these up.</p>
				
				<div class="img-div">
					<img src="src/cut.png">
					<div class="img-div-description">The numbers of jump cut in one project </div>
				</div>	
				
				<p>Next up is adding the some visual, sound effects to the footage. This includes things like:</p>
				
				<div class="list">
					<ul>
						<li>Color correction/other visuals that affect the mood of the clip.
							<ul>
								<li>Example: If we’re doing a dramatic edit, we might do some film noir-esque color correction.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Pan, zoom, crop.
							<ul>
								<li>Example: Having the camera follow certain players to help with context.</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li>Transitions</li>
						<li>Add whatever visuals we need to make our editing idea for the clip come to life.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<p>This is also very specific to the material we have, so it’s difficult to provide more examples since it changes from video to video.</p>
				
				<p>Once we've added all the visual effect, we spend a lot of time animating some of the text and images because it has a huge impact on the quality of the video.</p>
				
				<p>We like doing this because, due to the time it takes, it’s not something you see on a lot of other channels. We often motion track frame by frame to get it perfect, meaning we move the position of the text every single frame the object moves. Our videos have 60 frames per second, so that’s a lot of keyframes.</p>
				
				<div class="img-div">
					<img src="src/Keyframes.png">
					<div class="img-div-description">Keyframes for 1 second of images</div>
				</div>
				
				<p>After we're done with the visual effects we move onto sound effects, we usually have two purposes for them.</p> 
									
				<p>The first thing is to emphasize certain actions like punches, bounces, explosions, etc. The other way we use sound effects is to change the context of the clip, giving it a new perspective. We might add a sound effect or a song that sounds goofy to a clip that’s not supposed to be funny, but when the sound effect is added it suddenly gives new meaning to the material and makes it funny.<p>
				
				
				<div class="img-div">
					<video controls loop src="src/sound effect.mp4"></video>
					<div class="img-div-description">Volume image with motion tracking and sound effect</div>
				</div>
				
				<p>The effects used in this example are not very advanced, however, with a little brainstorming we were able to transform the clip into something totally new through creative editing. </p>
				
				<h2>3. Cinematics and B-Roll</h2>	
				
				<p>LoDravenn is not a content aggregator, we have a strict policy of transforming the footage in the livestream into something original with creative value. One way we do this is by recreating scenes from clips and recording those reenactments to give a new perspective to the clip. So we basically merge our original recordings with the clips in the footage to further transform the material.</p>
				
				<div class="img-div">
					<video autoplay loop muted src="src/replay.mp4"></video>
					<div class="img-div-description">B-Roll from Tyler1: League of Diamonds</div>
				</div>
				
				<p>When doing this in League of Legends for example we go find the specific game in the footage and reenact the scene. Then we go into replay mode and spend a while trying to get the perfect shot. This is quite difficult in League of Legends since they don’t let you change the perspective from top-down to close-up, save camera positions or set keyframes. So in order to archive this, we have to use the additional third-party software called Creator Suite.</p>
				
				<div class="img-div">
					<video autoplay loop muted src="src/replay2.mp4"></video>
					<div class="img-div-description">Once we have the recordings we want we merge them together with the original clips in Premiere.</div>
				</div>
				
				<h2>Examples</h2>	
				
				<p>Here is an example of how we turned a normal gameplay into something intense and inspirational through the creative use of cuts and music.</p>

				<h3> Original</h3>
				
				<div class="img-div">
					<video controls loop src="src/ex2.mp4"></video>
				</div>
				
				<h3> Edited</h3>
				<div class="img-div">
					<video controls loop src="src/ex3.mp4"></video>
				</div>
